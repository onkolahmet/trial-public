  "explanation": "The contract only addresses service of legal process by U.S. registered mail and refers generally to an address \u201cset forth below.\u201d  It does not establish a comprehensive notice provision for ordinary contractual notices under the NDA, nor does it set out email or other delivery methods, specific physical addresses, or a mechanism for updating those addresses.  Therefore it fails to meet the rule\u2019s requirement to specify the method and address for providing notices, including email or physical address.",
