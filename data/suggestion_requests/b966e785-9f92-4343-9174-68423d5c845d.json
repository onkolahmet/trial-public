  "explanation": "The contract only references that service of process, summons, notice or document may be effected by U.S. registered mail sent to an address \"set forth below,\" but the actual physical address is not provided in the text we have, and no email address or alternative notice methods are specified. Because the rule requires that the NDA expressly specify both the method and the actual address (email or physical) for providing notices, the current language is insufficient.",
