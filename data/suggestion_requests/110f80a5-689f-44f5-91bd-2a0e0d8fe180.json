  "explanation": "The clause only says that a waiver of one breach is not a waiver of earlier or later breaches and that no waiver is continuing. It does not address a party\u2019s failure or delay in enforcing a provision; therefore, it does not satisfy the requirement that failure to enforce any provision shall not constitute a waiver.",
  "rule": "State that failure to enforce any provision of the NDA does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision.",
  "exampleLanguage": "No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power, or privilege hereunder."
