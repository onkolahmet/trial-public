  "explanation": "The clause explicitly states that the Disclosing Party has no obligation to provide or update Confidential Information, but it is silent on any corresponding lack of obligation for the Receiving Party (or the other side) to disclose information. Because the rule requires that NEITHER party be obligated to disclose any particular information, the contract language only partially satisfies the requirement and therefore is not fully compliant.",
  "rule": "Clarify that neither party is obligated to disclose any particular information under the NDA.",
  "exampleLanguage": "Neither party is obligated to disclose any particular information under this Agreement."
