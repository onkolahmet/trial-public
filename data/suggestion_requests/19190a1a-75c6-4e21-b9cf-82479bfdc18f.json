  "explanation": "The clause obligates the Receiving Party to return or destroy \u201call Confidential Information\u201d upon the Disclosing Party\u2019s request, but it does not expressly extend this obligation to materials derived from the Confidential Information (e.g., copies, summaries, analyses, derivative works). Because the rule specifically requires the return or destruction of derivative materials, the current language is insufficient.",
  "rule": "Require the Recipient to return or destroy any materials derived from Confidential Information upon request.",
  "exampleLanguage": "Upon termination of this Agreement, or upon the Disclosing Party's written request, the Recipient shall promptly return or destroy all materials derived from the Confidential Information, including any copies, summaries, or analyses thereof, and certify in writing that such return or destruction has been completed."
