  "explanation": "The clause does state that the NDA \u2018constitutes the entire agreement \u2026 with respect to the subject matter hereof\u2019 and that it \u2018supersedes all prior discussions and agreements.\u2019  However, the rule requires the agreement to expressly supersede all prior \u2018agreements or understandings.\u2019  Because the clause omits a reference to \u2018understandings,\u2019 it does not fully satisfy the rule\u2019s requirement to cover that category explicitly.",
