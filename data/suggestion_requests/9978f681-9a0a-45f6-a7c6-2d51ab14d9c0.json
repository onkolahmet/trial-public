  "explanation": "The provided contract language defines the existence of the NDA, the potential transaction, and related terms as Confidential Information, but it does not contain any provision that expressly bars either party from issuing public announcements or press releases without the prior written consent of the other party. Merely classifying such information as Confidential Information is insufficient because the rule requires an explicit prohibition on public disclosure absent written consent. No clause in the excerpts imposes that specific restriction.",
  "rule": "Prohibit either party from making any public announcement or press release regarding the existence or terms of the NDA or the contemplated transaction without prior written consent.",
  "exampleLanguage": "Neither party shall make any public announcement or issue any press release regarding the existence or terms of this Agreement or the contemplated transaction without the prior written consent of the other party. This restriction does not apply to any disclosure required by law or any regulatory or governmental body."
