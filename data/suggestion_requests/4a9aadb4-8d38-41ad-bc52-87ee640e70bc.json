  "explanation": "The NDA\u2019s confidentiality clause lists the categories of persons who may receive Confidential Information, and that list does not mention the Receiving Party\u2019s affiliates. However, the separate non-solicitation clause contemplates that such affiliates may have received Confidential Information ('to the extent that any such affiliates have received Confidential Information'), without anywhere in the agreement expressly authorizing disclosure to affiliates or requiring that those affiliates be bound by equivalent confidentiality obligations. Because the agreement neither clearly includes affiliates as parties nor expressly permits their receipt of Confidential Information under stated conditions, the contract fails to satisfy the rule\u2019s requirement to clarify the status of affiliates.",
  "rule": "Clarify whether affiliates of the parties are included as parties to the NDA or are permitted to receive Confidential Information.",
  "exampleLanguage": "The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its Affiliates, provided that such Affiliates are bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those contained in this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall remain fully responsible for ensuring that its Affiliates comply with these obligations."
