  "explanation": "The clause only states that an express waiver of a breach does not extend to other breaches or create a continuing waiver. It does not address the situation where a party simply fails or delays to enforce a provision, which the rule expressly requires. Therefore, the required \u2018failure to enforce does not equal waiver\u2019 language is missing.",
  "rule": "State that failure to enforce any provision of the NDA does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision.",
  "exampleLanguage": "No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power, or privilege hereunder."
