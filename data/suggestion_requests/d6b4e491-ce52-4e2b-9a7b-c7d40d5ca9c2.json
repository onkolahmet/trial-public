  "explanation": "The contract language treats the existence and terms of the agreement and the contemplated transaction as Confidential Information, but nowhere does it expressly prohibit either party from issuing a public announcement or press release without the other party\u2019s prior written consent. The rule requires an explicit prohibition on public announcements or press releases absent such consent. Because the provided sections only define what is Confidential Information and outline procedures for legally-compelled disclosures\u2014without specifically restricting public announcements or press releases\u2014the contract does not satisfy the rule.",
  "rule": "Prohibit either party from making any public announcement or press release regarding the existence or terms of the NDA or the contemplated transaction without prior written consent.",
  "exampleLanguage": "Neither party shall make any public announcement or issue any press release regarding the existence or terms of this Agreement or the contemplated transaction without the prior written consent of the other party. This restriction does not apply to any disclosure required by law or any regulatory or governmental body."
