  "explanation": "The clause addresses assignment and notes that the Receiving Party signs for the benefit of the Disclosing Party, but it never includes an express disclaimer that no non-party (third party) has rights under the Agreement. The rule requires the NDA to affirmatively state that there are no third-party beneficiaries unless expressly provided. Because that statement is absent, the clause is not compliant.",
  "rule": "State that there are no third party beneficiaries to the NDA unless expressly provided.",
  "exampleLanguage": "This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit, or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement."
