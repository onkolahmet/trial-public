  "explanation": "The agreement does not include an express disclaimer that no third parties have any rights under the NDA. While the clause describes enforcement rights for the Disclosing Party and addresses assignment, it never states that persons or entities other than the named parties have no beneficiary status. Because the rule requires the contract to affirmatively state that there are no third-party beneficiaries unless expressly provided, the present language is not compliant.",
