  "explanation": "The contract only references service of process by U.S. registered mail to an unspecified \u201caddress set forth below,\u201d and it does so in the context of litigation rather than ordinary notices under the NDA. It does not set out a comprehensive notice procedure or actually list any physical or email addresses. Because the rule requires that the NDA specify both the method and the actual address (physical and/or email) for providing notices, this provision is insufficient.",
  "rule": "Specify the method and address for providing notices under the NDA, including email or physical address.",
  "exampleLanguage": "All notices, requests, waivers, and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and are conclusively deemed to have been duly given: when hand-delivered to the other Party; when received if sent by facsimile or electronic mail to the number or email address set forth below, provided that the sending Party receives a confirmation of delivery; three (3) business days after deposit in the U.S. mail, with first class or certified mail, receipt requested, postage prepaid, and addressed to the other Party; or forty-eight (48) hours after deposit with an internationally recognized overnight delivery service, postage prepaid, addressed to the other Party as set forth below with next business-day delivery guaranteed, provided that the sending Party receives a confirmation of delivery from the delivery service provider. A Party may change or supplement the addresses, facsimile numbers, and email addresses provided in its signature block below, or designate additional addresses, facsimile numbers, or email addresses, for purposes of this Section by giving the other Party written notice of the new address, facsimile numbers, or email addresses in the manner set forth above."
