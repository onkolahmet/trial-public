  "explanation": "The clause expressly states that the Disclosing Party has no obligation to provide Confidential Information, but it is silent as to whether the Receiving Party (or the other party, in a mutual NDA scenario) has any obligation to disclose information. Because the rule requires the contract to clarify that neither party is obligated to disclose any particular information, the current language only partially satisfies the requirement and is therefore not fully compliant.",
  "rule": "Clarify that neither party is obligated to disclose any particular information under the NDA.",
