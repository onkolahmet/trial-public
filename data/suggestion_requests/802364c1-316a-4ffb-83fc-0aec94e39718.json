  "explanation": "The NDA specifies that Confidential Information may be shared only with the Receiving Party\u2019s \u201cdirectors, officers, employees, advisors, legal counselors, consultants and agents\u201d who need to know the information. It does not state that the Receiving Party\u2019s or Disclosing Party\u2019s affiliates are automatically parties to the NDA or may receive Confidential Information. Affiliates are mentioned only in the context of the Disclosing Party\u2019s right to assign its rights, which does not clarify their status as permitted recipients of Confidential Information. Because the agreement does not explicitly include or exclude affiliates as parties or permitted recipients, it fails to satisfy the rule\u2019s requirement for clarity on this point.",
  "rule": "Clarify whether affiliates of the parties are included as parties to the NDA or are permitted to receive Confidential Information.",
  "exampleLanguage": "The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its Affiliates, provided that such Affiliates are bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those contained in this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall remain fully responsible for ensuring that its Affiliates comply with these obligations."
