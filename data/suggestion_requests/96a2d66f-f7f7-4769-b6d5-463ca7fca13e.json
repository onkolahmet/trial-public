  "explanation": "The contract does say that Confidential Information \"will remain subject to the terms of this Agreement notwithstanding its termination\"; however, it does not specify a definite survival period (e.g., three years, five years, etc.). The rule requires the NDA to state that confidentiality obligations survive termination or expiration for a specified period, and no such period is provided. Therefore, the contract does not satisfy the rule.",
  "rule": "State that confidentiality obligations survive termination or expiration of the NDA for the specified period.",
