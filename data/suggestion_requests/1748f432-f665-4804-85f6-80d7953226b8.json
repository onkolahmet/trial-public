  "explanation": "The clause defines Confidential Information to include all information provided by the Disclosing Party 'whether or not marked or otherwise identified as confidential.' This directly contradicts the rule, which requires a marking (or subsequent written summary for oral disclosures) as a condition for protection. Because the contract grants confidentiality even when no such marking is present, it fails to adopt the mandatory marking requirement set out by the rule.",
  "rule": "Require that Confidential Information be clearly marked as 'confidential' or with a similar legend to be protected under the NDA.",
  "exampleLanguage": "The Disclosing Party shall clearly mark all Confidential Information provided to the Receiving Party in writing as \"Confidential\" or with a similar legend. For Confidential Information disclosed orally or visually, the Disclosing Party shall, within [30] days of disclosure, provide the Receiving Party with a written summary of such information, clearly marked as \"Confidential\" or with a similar legend. The Receiving Party shall have no obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any information that is not marked or summarized as confidential in accordance with this clause."
