  "explanation": "The agreement states that (i) it terminates after one year and does not expressly extend the confidentiality obligations beyond that date, and (ii) any retained back-up copies of Confidential Information will remain subject to the NDA only for as long as those materials are kept. This language does not provide a definite survival period (e.g., \u201cfive years\u201d) for the confidentiality obligations as required by the rule; it simply ties survival to the indefinite duration of retention. Because no specific post-termination time period is stated, the contract does not satisfy the rule requiring that confidentiality obligations survive for a specified period.",
  "rule": "State that confidentiality obligations survive termination or expiration of the NDA for the specified period.",
  "exampleLanguage": "The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years."
