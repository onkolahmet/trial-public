  "explanation": "The clause only states that the entire agreement terminates one year from the effective date and merely clarifies that past breaches remain actionable. It does not set any specific period during which the confidentiality obligations themselves continue after disclosure or after termination, nor does it establish a 2-5 year survival period as required. Therefore the contract fails to specify the required duration of confidentiality obligations.",
  "rule": "Specify the duration of confidentiality obligations, commonly two to five years from the date of disclosure or termination of the agreement.",
  "exampleLanguage": "The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of [three (3)] years following the date of disclosure of any Confidential Information, or for a period of [three (3)] years following the termination of this Agreement, whichever is later."
