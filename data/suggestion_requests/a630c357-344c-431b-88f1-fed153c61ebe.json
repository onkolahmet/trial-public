  "explanation": "The clause says that no rights or licenses \"of any nature\" are implied or granted, which is a broad waiver but it does not expressly state that the disclosure of Confidential Information gives no license under any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual-property right. The rule requires that specific point to be made. Because the contract language stops short of explicitly linking the absence of a license to the disclosure of Confidential Information and does not expressly reference patent or copyright rights, it does not fully satisfy the rule.",
  "rule": "State that disclosure of Confidential Information does not grant any license or right under any patent, copyright, or other intellectual property right.",
