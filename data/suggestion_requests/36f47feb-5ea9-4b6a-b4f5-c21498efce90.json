  "explanation": "The confidentiality provision lists the categories of permissible recipients as the Receiving Party\u2019s \"Representatives,\" defined to include directors, officers, employees, advisors, legal counselors, consultants, financing sources, and agents.  Affiliates are not mentioned, so it is unclear whether an affiliate may receive Confidential Information and, if so, whether it must be bound by equivalent confidentiality obligations.  The only reference to affiliates appears in the non-solicitation clause and relates solely to hiring restrictions, not to the handling of Confidential Information.  Because the agreement does not expressly include affiliates as parties or authorized recipients of Confidential Information, nor imposes confidentiality obligations on them, the contract does not satisfy the rule\u2019s requirement that the treatment of affiliates be clarified.",
  "rule": "Clarify whether affiliates of the parties are included as parties to the NDA or are permitted to receive Confidential Information.",
  "exampleLanguage": "The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its Affiliates, provided that such Affiliates are bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those contained in this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall remain fully responsible for ensuring that its Affiliates comply with these obligations."
