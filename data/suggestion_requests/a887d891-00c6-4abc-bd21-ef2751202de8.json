  "explanation": "The agreement\u2019s confidentiality obligations are not limited to a fixed period of two-to-five years. The agreement terminates after only one year, yet Section 4 states that any retained Confidential Information remains subject to the Agreement for as long as it is retained, creating an indefinite confidentiality obligation. Because the rule requires the confidentiality obligation to be expressly limited to a specified duration (typically two to five years from disclosure or termination), the contract fails to comply.",
  "rule": "Specify the duration of confidentiality obligations, commonly two to five years from the date of disclosure or termination of the agreement.",
  "exampleLanguage": "The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of [three (3)] years following the date of disclosure of any Confidential Information, or for a period of [three (3)] years following the termination of this Agreement, whichever is later."
