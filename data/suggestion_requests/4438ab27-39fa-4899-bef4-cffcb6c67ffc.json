  "explanation": "The clause only says that an affirmative waiver of a breach will not be construed as a waiver of other or future breaches. It does not state that mere inaction or failure to enforce a provision (i.e., no waiver through silence or delay) preserves the parties\u2019 rights, which is the specific requirement of the \u2018No Waiver\u2019 rule.",
  "rule": "State that failure to enforce any provision of the NDA does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision.",
  "exampleLanguage": "No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power, or privilege hereunder."
