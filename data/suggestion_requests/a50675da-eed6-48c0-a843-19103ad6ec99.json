  "explanation": "The agreement says that any Confidential Information the Receiving Party must keep (e.g., for legal compliance or on back-up media) \"will remain subject to the terms of this Agreement notwithstanding its termination for so long as such material is retained.\"  While this language makes the confidentiality obligations continue after termination, it does not set an explicit survival period (e.g., 3 years, 5 years).  The lawyer\u2019s rule requires the NDA to specify a definite post-termination duration for the confidentiality obligations.  Because the contract lacks such a defined period, it does not satisfy the rule.",
  "rule": "State that confidentiality obligations survive termination or expiration of the NDA for the specified period.",
  "exampleLanguage": "The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years."
