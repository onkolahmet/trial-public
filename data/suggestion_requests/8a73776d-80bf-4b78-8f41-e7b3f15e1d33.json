  "explanation": "The clause only states that a waiver of a specific breach does not extend to earlier or later breaches and is not a continuing waiver. It does NOT address a situation where a party merely fails or delays to enforce a provision. The rule specifically requires the NDA to state that such failure or delay does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other, which is missing here.",
  "rule": "State that failure to enforce any provision of the NDA does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision.",
  "exampleLanguage": "No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power, or privilege hereunder."
