  "explanation": "The clause states that Confidential Information includes all information provided, 'whether or not marked or otherwise identified as confidential.' The lawyer\u2019s rule requires that information must be clearly marked (or followed by a written summary) to qualify for protection. Because the contract explicitly removes any marking requirement and treats unmarked information as confidential, it conflicts with the rule\u2019s mandatory marking condition.",
  "rule": "Require that Confidential Information be clearly marked as 'confidential' or with a similar legend to be protected under the NDA.",

For Confidential Information disclosed orally or visually, the Disclosing Party shall, within [30] days of disclosure, provide the Receiving Party with a written summary of such information, clearly marked as \"Confidential\" or with a similar legend. The Receiving Party shall have no obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any information that is not marked or summarized as confidential in accordance with this clause."
