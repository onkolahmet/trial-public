  "explanation": "The contract only states that service may be made by U.S. registered mail to \u201cits address set forth below,\u201d without actually listing that address and without mentioning any email address or other notice methods. The rule requires that the NDA expressly specify both the methods (e.g., mail, email) and the actual physical or email addresses to be used. Because the contract text provides neither a concrete address nor an email option, it fails to meet the notice-requirements rule.",
  "rule": "Specify the method and address for providing notices under the NDA, including email or physical address.",
