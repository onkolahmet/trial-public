  "explanation": "The clause permits the Disclosing Party to freely assign the Agreement to its affiliates or successors without obtaining the Receiving Party\u2019s prior written consent, while restricting only the Receiving Party\u2019s ability to assign. The rule requires that neither party be able to assign without the other party\u2019s prior written consent. Because the Disclosing Party is expressly allowed to assign without such consent, the provision does not satisfy the rule.",
  "rule": "Prohibit assignment of the NDA or rights under it by either party without the prior written consent of the other party.",
  "exampleLanguage": "Neither party may assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party."
