  "explanation": "The clause only states that the Agreement terminates after one year and merely preserves liability for breaches that occurred before termination. It does not expressly continue the confidentiality obligations for a set period (e.g., two-to-five years) after disclosure or after termination, as required by the rule. Therefore, it fails to specify the required post-termination confidentiality duration.",
  "rule": "Specify the duration of confidentiality obligations, commonly two to five years from the date of disclosure or termination of the agreement.",
  "exampleLanguage": "The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of [three (3)] years following the date of disclosure of any Confidential Information, or for a period of [three (3)] years following the termination of this Agreement, whichever is later."
