  "explanation": "The clause obligates the Receiving Party to \u201cpromptly notify the Disclosing Party\u201d of any compelled disclosure so the Discloser can seek protective relief. However, it does not state that notification may be withheld if such notice is prohibited by law (e.g., gag order or sealed subpoena). The lawyer\u2019s rule expressly requires the notice obligation to include an \u201cunless prohibited by law\u201d carve-out. Because the contract omits this carve-out, it does not fully satisfy the rule.",
  "rule": "Require the Recipient to notify the Discloser of any subpoena or legal process seeking Confidential Information, unless prohibited by law.",
  "exampleLanguage": "If the Recipient receives a subpoena, court order, or other legal process requesting disclosure of any Confidential Information, the Recipient shall promptly notify the Discloser in writing, unless prohibited by law, to allow the Discloser to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy."
