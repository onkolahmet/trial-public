  "explanation": "The clause obligates the Receiving Party to return or destroy \"all Confidential Information\" upon the Disclosing Party\u2019s request, but it does not expressly extend that obligation to materials that are merely derived from, based on, or incorporating the Confidential Information (e.g., notes, summaries, analyses). Because the rule specifically requires an explicit obligation to return or destroy such derivative materials, the current language is not sufficiently comprehensive.",
  "rule": "Require the Recipient to return or destroy any materials derived from Confidential Information upon request.",
  "exampleLanguage": "Upon termination of this Agreement, or upon the Disclosing Party's written request, the Recipient shall promptly return or destroy all materials derived from the Confidential Information, including any copies, summaries, or analyses thereof, and certify in writing that such return or destruction has been completed."
