  "explanation": "The clause obligates the Receiving Party to return or destroy \u201call Confidential Information,\u201d but it never expressly extends that obligation to materials derived from the Confidential Information (e.g., copies, summaries, analyses, or other derivative works). Because the rule requires an explicit obligation to return or destroy derivative materials, and the contract language only references the underlying Confidential Information without specifying derivatives, the provision does not fully meet the rule\u2019s requirements.",
  "rule": "Require the Recipient to return or destroy any materials derived from Confidential Information upon request.",
  "exampleLanguage": "Upon termination of this Agreement, or upon the Disclosing Party's written request, the Recipient shall promptly return or destroy all materials derived from the Confidential Information, including any copies, summaries, or analyses thereof, and certify in writing that such return or destruction has been completed."
