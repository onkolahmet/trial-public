  "explanation": "The clause only states that the entire agreement ends after one year and that the Receiving Party remains liable for breaches that occurred before that termination. It does not set a distinct confidentiality-obligation period (e.g., two to five years after disclosure or after termination). Because the rule requires that the contract expressly specify such a multi-year confidentiality duration, the present language is not sufficient.",
  "rule": "Specify the duration of confidentiality obligations, commonly two to five years from the date of disclosure or termination of the agreement.",
  "exampleLanguage": "The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of [three (3)] years following the date of disclosure of any Confidential Information, or for a period of [three (3)] years following the termination of this Agreement, whichever is later."
