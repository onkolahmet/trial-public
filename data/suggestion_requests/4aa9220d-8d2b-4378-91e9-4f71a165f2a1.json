  "explanation": "The agreement does not include an explicit clause stating that the confidentiality obligations survive termination or expiration for a defined period (e.g., five years). Section 4 only says the information will remain subject to the NDA for as long as it is retained, and Section 9 merely addresses liability for prior breaches. Neither provision sets a fixed survival period, which the rule requires.",
  "rule": "State that confidentiality obligations survive termination or expiration of the NDA for the specified period.",
