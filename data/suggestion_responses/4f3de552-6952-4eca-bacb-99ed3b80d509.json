The Receiving Party will certify such destruction in writing signed by an officer of the Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving Party may retain Confidential Information (a) as required to comply with bona fide legal or regulatory compliance obligations provided that such retained information is segregated and securely managed to prevent unauthorized access, and (b) in electronic format on system back-up tapes or other system back-up media according to industry-standard electronic back-up and archival procedures. Confidential Information so retained will remain subject to the terms of this Agreement notwithstanding its termination for so long as such material is retained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party\u2019s personnel may use Confidential Information retained in their unaided memory, provided such use does not result in intentional disclosure or use of Confidential Information."
